Semantic log compression and search prototype

The aim of this software is to identify (with some smart logic,
eventually with some AI) semantic similarities between lines of log
files and to use these similarities for a high compression ratio.

The 'semlogcompress' tool (we could rename it to 'sc') does the
compression, and the 'scgrep' tool is for search in analogy to the
regular grep. Later, a notification/alerting tool will be added.

Even though the analysis starts with syntactic tokenisation, the
potential to compress semantically is high. For instance:
 192.168.0.19 -> IP address is 12 bytes long as string
 as integer: 4 bytes
 as subnet: 2 fixed bytes + 2 changing bytes
Often, only few bytes (e.g. IP address, port number, time stamp, user
id) change while the rest of the log messages remains the same. This
provides a high potential for compression.

Tool invocation:

Run ./semlogcompress -h to find out about command line parameters.
