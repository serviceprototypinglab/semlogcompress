Semantic log compression, search and alerting prototype
-------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this software is to identify (with some smart logic,
eventually with some AI) semantic similarities between lines of log
files and to use these similarities for a high compression ratio.

The 'slc' tool performs the extraction of attributes and the compression
and index creation, and the 'slcgrep' tool is for indexed search in
analogy to the regular grep. Additionally, the 'slcnotify' tool is
available to trigger hooks upon occurrence of an attribute value.
Finally, 'netlogserve' is used to emulate a networked logging service.

Even though the analysis starts with syntactic tokenisation, the
potential to compress semantically is high. For instance:
 192.168.0.19 -> IP address is 12 bytes long as string
 as integer: 4 bytes
 as subnet: 2 fixed bytes + 2 changing bytes
Often, only few bytes (e.g. IP address, port number, time stamp, user
id) change while the rest of the log messages remains the same. This
provides a high potential for compression.
