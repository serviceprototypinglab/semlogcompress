Random ideas... to be validated with the emerging implementation

local:10.1.1.90/***5*
 -> here, the * are recognised as numbers but the 5 digits are not yet recognised as contiguous
    !!! in latest implementation, these two change sets are now connected into a contiguous one based on type equality of the '5' in between
 -> should identify as port number because it is close to IP address (more false positive likelihood with lower port numbers though)
